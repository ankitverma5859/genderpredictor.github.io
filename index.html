In fact, I try to gravitate to a more neutral position on the gender spectrum. That being said, there are days where I do feel more masculine or feminine and my presentation will vary based on that. So to answer your question, the decision is ultimately up to you whether you choose to use non-binary as an identifier, but know that you could definitely fit under the term should you choose to use it ðŸ˜Š">You absolutely can be!

It's an umbrella for all identities that aren't fully binary after all, you don't have to be super androgynous or anything to be allowed to use the label :) There are also people who identify as nonbinary women/men and that's valid too!

Just because youâ€™re nonbinary doesnâ€™t mean you have to walk a line down the middle of the gender binary. You already have a name you like, why mess up a good thing? You get to be whoever you are, we donâ€™t have to try to be the purple in between the pink and blue if thatâ€™s not what colour we really are, thereâ€™s a whole damn rainbow out there for us and pink and blue are both parts of the rainbow we can pick from to figure out what feels right for ourselves.">When I changed my name after I first came out I chose a gendered name.

Consider the costs of selling your house, new drapes and other furnishings, etc. as well as the actual cost of the move.  And your current house is paid off but in Cincy you might have a mortgage.
